# Morph Docker Buildstep Base

The Dockerfile in this repo creates the base docker image which is used for openaustralia/buildstep.

It's basically something very similar to the cedar platform on Heroku with a few extra libraries
installed that we want to use.

So, if you need an extra library installed in Morph.io this is the likely repo that you will need
to modify.
